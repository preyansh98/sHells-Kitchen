Assumptions:
1. quit within a script (run script) will quit the shell. In my opinion, I don't see why running commands through a script in comparison to running comparisons by stdin directly should be treated differently. A script should just be to savework by piling commands in a file, but should mimic same behaviour as someone entering commands manually.
